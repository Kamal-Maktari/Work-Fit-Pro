# Final Year Project

Work Fit Pro - A Workout App

## Local Development

To run this project in your development machine, follow these steps:

1. Create and activate a conda environment by running the command: 

```console
$ conda create --name myenv python
```

Followed by: 

```console
$ conda activate myenv
```

2. Install Django in the conda environment by running the command: 

```console
$ pip install django
```

3. Clone this repo by running the command: 

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/KamalM-01/Final-Year-Project.git
```

4. Once cloned onto local folder, change directory to 'Work Fit Pro' which can be done by running the command: 

```console
$ cd 'Work Fit Pro'
```

5. Once in the 'Work Fit Pro' folder, install npm by running the command: 

```console
$ npm install
```

6. First option is to scan the QR code that displays in the terminal to run the app on a IOS/Android device, which requires 'Expo Go' to be installed (can be found in App Store/Play Store). Second option is to have a IOS/Android emulator downloaded onto your local machine to run the app. Once downloaded, turn on the emulator. 

7. Once you do one of the 2 options in step 6, un the command: 

```console
$ npm start
```
 
8. If you chose to do the first option of step 6 then scan the QR code displayed on the terminal. If you chose to do the second option of step 6, press 'i' if using IOS emulator, or press 'a' if using Android emulator.

9. Work Fit Pro should now be running on your chosen device.
